## Badass Pipeline

A [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) example boilerplate with a configured **Badass Asset Pipeline** based on Sprockets and Sprockets Helpers. It's used as a reference for a post at my [blog](http://blog.javivelasco.com). You can use it as a starting point for your asset file managing system in your projects. Enjoy!
